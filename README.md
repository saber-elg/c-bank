C-bank  is a Bank Account Management System in C, a console-based application designed to efficiently manage and perform basic operations on bank accounts. The project incorporates features such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and account closure. Users can create new accounts, deposit funds into their accounts, withdraw money, check their account balances, and close their accounts if needed.

Key Features:
1. Account Creation: Users can create new bank accounts by providing essential information such as account holder name, account type, initial deposit amount, etc.

2. Deposit Operation: Account holders can deposit funds into their accounts, specifying the amount they wish to add. The system updates the account balance accordingly.

3. Withdrawal Operation: Account holders can withdraw money from their accounts, ensuring that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance.

4. Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balances at any time, providing them with real-time information about the financial status of their accounts.

5. Account Closure: The system allows users to close their accounts, provided there are no outstanding balances. Closing an account removes it from the system and updates the overall account list.

6. Error Handling: The application incorporates error handling mechanisms to address scenarios such as insufficient funds during withdrawals and invalid inputs during account creation.

7. Data Persistence:** Account information is stored persistently in files to ensure that account details are retained even when the program is closed and reopened.

8. Security Measures:** Basic security measures are implemented, such as password protection and secure file handling, to safeguard sensitive user information.

This Bank Account Management System provides a practical and interactive solution for managing bank accounts through a straightforward console interface, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
